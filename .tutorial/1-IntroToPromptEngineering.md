# Implementing an Auto-Summarizer


## Course Introduction
Welcome to the final day of this course! Today we will create a summarization bot that uses GPT-3's most powerful model to summarize any length text into any format we want. 
We will also take one last look at the discussion around 'How should AI systems behave, and who should decide?'

Hopefully you will leave today with a firm understanding of prompt engineering, how it can help us create more complex projects with GPT3, and ideas on how to use it to build something new!
